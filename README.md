# The reversal plane

The reversal plane is positioned between the Sun and Sagittarius Arm and tilted towards the Sun above the Galactic midplane and away below. 
Above the reversal, the large-scale magnetic field is counterclockwise (red arrows) as viewed from the North Galactic Pole. Below the reversal, the magnetic field is clockwise (blue arrows).
The positive x-axis points towards the Galactic centre.

Parameters tha describe the reversal plane geometry are: 

$\ell_n$ - the horizontal tilt angle of the plane, the horizontal angle between the positive x-axis and the plane normal

$b_n$ - the vertical tilt angle of the plane, the vertical angle between the positive x-axis and the plane normal

$x_0$ = the distance between the SUn and the point on the positive x-axis that intersects the plane
